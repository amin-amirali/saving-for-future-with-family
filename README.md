# saving-for-future-with-family
Welcome to the Investment Tracker for Family Funds! This project is designed to keep your family informed on how the money they have generously sent to your children is being invested and used to secure their financial future.

With this project, you can share updates on the progress of your investments and any relevant developments with your loved ones. Whatever the objective you have envisioned, this project will help you keep your family in the loop and provide them with the peace of mind that their support is being put to good use.
